In the Deadlift, if you compete with the Sumo Deadlift, 
you should introduce it into your program in the Strength 
Phase. You may not want to include it from the floor every 
week, as this can be very stressful to the hips, but using it 
every other week, alternating with either Sumo Block Pulls 
or Conventional variations is a useful strategy.
